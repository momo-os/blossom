# üå∏ Blossom - A Delightful Package Manager for Linux

Blossom is a modern, efficient, and charming package manager designed for Linux
and Unix-like operating systems. Inspired by the simplicity and flexibility of
Arch Linux‚Äôs `pacman` and Alpine Linux‚Äôs `apk`, Blossom introduces a
thoughtfully crafted architecture, with a focus on ease of use and advanced
performance optimizations. Built using rust Blossom provides a secure, fast, and
elegant way to manage software on your system.

Whether you‚Äôre installing binary packages or building software from source,
Blossom is designed to make package management an enjoyable and streamlined
experience. With features like multi-level optimizations and a rolling release
model, Blossom ensures your system stays current, performant, and beautifully
organized.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unified Packaging Format**: Packages, playfully called _peaches_, are
  described using simple TOML manifest files, making it easy to create and
  maintain them. The full schema for package definitions can be found
  [here](PACKAGE.md).

- **Binary & Source Package Support**: Choose between pre-compiled binaries for
  quick installations or build from source for greater control and
  customization.

- **Optimization Levels**: To squeeze the most out of your hardware, Blossom
  supports multiple optimization levels, such as `x86_64-v3`, enabling higher
  performance on modern CPUs while maintaining compatibility with older
  architectures.

- **Rolling Release Model**: Blossom adopts a rolling release model, ensuring
  packages are continuously updated. Security patches and bug fixes are
  automatically backported, keeping your system stable and secure without the
  hassle of waiting for major version releases.

- **Modern & Secure**: By utilizing Rust, Blossom is designed with safety and
  performance in mind. It reduces common vulnerabilities and offers a robust
  core for managing your packages efficiently.

- **Simplicity Meets Flexibility**: Blossom is intuitive and user-friendly while
  offering advanced features for power users. From dependency resolution to
  handling package conflicts, Blossom ensures your system remains organized and
  up to date with minimal effort.
